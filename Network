TCP Optimzier 
======================
Its a software provided by "SpeedGuide" that wraps bunch of registry changes inside one UI.
Since most settings are TCP related, don't expect any significant (or any) change in UDP connections.
Gaming for example is mostly UDP. 
Settings:
TCP window auto-tuning - Disabled //least possible latency at the cost of throughput.
Windows scaling heuristics - Disabled //garbage feature which dynamically changes auto-tuning based on your connection stats, its bad.
Congestion control provider - CTCP/CUBIC/NewReno //This one is kinda significant, for me, NewReno had the least latency related issues. Cubic is mostly for Throughput and CTCP is another alternative for lossy connections
RSS - Disabled //Parrarelized processing can cause stuttering if your cpu isnt strong enough
RSC - Disabled //coalescing is another setting to reduce cpu interrupts at the cost of latency.
ECN capability - Disabled //Its good for lossy connections that struggle with packet loss, but usually most routers wont support it and it added a bit of latency for me during my gaming sessions.
